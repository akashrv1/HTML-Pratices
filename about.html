		<p><span style="font-size: 20px"> The India Today Group is India's most respected and diversified media conglomerate. Founded in 1975 in response to the Emergency, its entire ethos is underpinned by the central belief that an independent media is the bedrock of democracy.Over 45 years, it has painstakingly built on this principle. Story by story. Edition by edition. Platform by platform. It has created a deep legacy of credibility, excellence, trust, and bi-partisanship. It is widely admired as the gold standard of journalism in the country. In a landscape marked by shrill polarities, it has only one political alignment: the Indian Constitution.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 20px">ITG's media enterprise started out with the iconic India Today magazine. For over 4 decades it was the undisputed high table of Indian journalism. It served up legendary stories, legendary journalists, legendary editors. It was famous for its meticulousness. It set the bar. Today the ITG universe has expanded into a vast canvas of four 24/7 national television channels, 18 digital platforms, and nine magazines. It reaches a staggering 500 million viewers monthly and covers every discipline that impacts human affairs: from politics and economy to sports, satire, art, business, entertainment, luxury, health, weddings, technology, science, environment, sex, relationships, parenting, life. It is a multi-brand, multi-platform, multi-vertical media group. But all of its varied canvas is threaded together by one common inviolable thread: credibility & excellence.</span> </p>
