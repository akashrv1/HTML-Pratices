	<h1>Trump's last-minute head tilt that saved his life has illegal immigrant twist<hr></h1>
	<p><span style="font-size: 20px">Almost 10 years ago when Donald Trump said, "What separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate", many, including the former American President who narrowly escaped a shooting on Saturday, would not have realised the relatability of the statement.Although the question of winner and loser will be settled later in November, Trump's dodging the bullet on Saturday itself might just qualify as a winner. <br>A last-minute head tilt saved him. That's what Trump said after being escorted off the stage after being hit by a bullet to his right ear. That chart that I was going over saved my life," said Trump, the Republican frontrunner, to the former White House physician Representative Ronny Jackson on a phone call, hours after the assassination attempt.On Saturday, while Donald Trump was speaking at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, shots were fired towards the stage. Trump, who had been looking straight, momentarily had turned to his right to point to an immigration chart at the time, which he believes saved his life.The Secret Service agents immediately responded, forming a protective shield around him. Trump was seen holding his ear and quickly getting down on the ground. After the agents helped him up, he stood, bloodied, and pumped his fist to cheering supporters before leaving the scene for medical treatment."He[Trump] goes, 'The border patrol saved my life,'" Dr Jackson recounted in an interview with The New York Times."'I was going over that border patrol chart.<br>' He said, 'If I hadn't pointed at that chart and turned my head to look at it, that bullet would have hit me right in the head'," added Ronny Jackson, the Texas Congressman.The immigration chart in question, which Trump referred to moments before being shot in the ear, displayed border-crossing statistics and was part of Trump's speech on immigration policies.The chart displayed on a big screen was a part of Trump's speech. According to a photo published by The New York Times, the chart said, "Illegal Immigration into the US".The chart showed how the number of illegal immigrants into the US rose between 2012 and 2024. It also said, "Nothing like this has ever happened to our country before".</span></p>
